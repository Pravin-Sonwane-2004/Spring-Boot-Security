## About The Project

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of various Spring Boot Security features and best practices. It's designed as a multi-module application to illustrate how different services can interact securely, encompassing aspects like user authentication, authorization, and potentially client-server communication with security in mind. The project includes modules for a security server, login/registration functionalities, and different types of clients (e.g., Feign client, Web client).

### Project Modules

* `security-login_register-1111`: Handles user registration and authentication processes.
* `security-project-8080`: The main security application, likely responsible for core security logic, user management, and serving as a resource server.
* `feign-client-9090`: A client application demonstrating inter-service communication using Feign, potentially consuming secure endpoints from `security-project-8080`.
* `web-client-5555`: A client application, possibly a simple web interface, demonstrating how a frontend can interact with the secure backend.

### Built With

* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* [Java](https://www.java.com/)
* [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (for dependency management)
* [Spring Cloud OpenFeign](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-openfeign) (for Feign Client)
* *(Optional: Add specific database like [H2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) or [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) if used for user storage)*
* *(Optional: Add frontend technologies here if applicable for web-client, e.g., [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), [Angular](https://angular.io/))*

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of this Spring Boot Security application up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
* Apache Maven (or use the included Maven wrapper)
* *(Optional: A database server like MySQL or PostgreSQL if user data is persisted externally)*

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Pravin-Sonwane-2004/Spring-Boot-Security.git](https://github.com/Pravin-Sonwane-2004/Spring-Boot-Security.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Spring-Boot-Security
    ```
3.  **Build the entire multi-module project:**
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    # On Windows, use:
    # mvnw clean install
    ```
    This command will build all modules.

4.  **Configure Application Properties:**
    * Review `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) files within each module's `src/main/resources` folder. You may need to adjust port numbers, database connections, or security configurations based on your local setup.

---

## Usage

To run the application, you will typically need to start the different modules in a specific order, especially if they depend on each other (e.g., the security server should be up before clients try to connect).

### Running Individual Modules

Navigate into each module's directory and run it using the Spring Boot Maven plugin:

1.  **Start the Security Project (e.g., `security-project-8080` first):**
    ```bash
    cd security-project-8080
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
2.  **Start the Login/Register Service (e.g., `security-login_register-1111`):**
    ```bash
    cd ../security-login_register-1111
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
3.  **Start the Feign Client (e.g., `feign-client-9090`):**
    ```bash
    cd ../feign-client-9090
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
4.  **Start the Web Client (e.g., `web-client-5555`):**
    ```bash
    cd ../web-client-5555
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

Once all necessary modules are running, you can interact with the application via the web client or by directly hitting the API endpoints of the respective services using tools like Postman or curl.

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Pravin-Sonwane-2004/Spring-Boot-Security/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

* [ ] Implement OAuth2/JWT for token-based authentication.
* [ ] Enhance role-based access control (RBAC) with more granular permissions.
* [ ] Add integration with an external identity provider (e.g., Okta, Auth0).
* [ ] Implement password encryption and stronger security practices.
* [ ] Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for all security aspects.
* [ ] Containerize each module using Docker for easier deployment.
* [ ] Add a CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments.
